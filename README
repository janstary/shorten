This is a fork of Tony Robinson's shorten,
stemming from version 2.3a, the last one by him.

(There was a previous effort by Jason Jordan,
see http://shnutils.freeshell.org/shorten/ for 3.6.1)

Decidedly, we use the last official version which is simpler,
has no aiff support and no seek tables and is not cluttered
with the GNU autotools. The initial commit is 2.3a verbatim.

As most of Dr. Robinson's code predates the C99 standard,
there are obvious updates to be made: every system has
stdint.h and abs(3), we don't need to have a homegrown
getopt(3) or do what err(3) does nowadays. There is barely
any functional change, the compression and decompression
works as in 2.3a and still passes the original tests.
